<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools are closed suddenly leaving Mrs. Ojha wondering how
she is going to improve the Math skills of her mischievous son Ash Jr. who is presently in
class 2 and refuses to study at home. She tried hard to make him follow the online classes of
his school teacher, but all her efforts were futile. Help Mrs. Ojha by designing an adaptive
learning application that will help Ash Jr. to learn different topics in an engaging,
playful, and interactive manner.<p>

<h3>In order to make learning joyful for the students, a reward
and recognition system can be made. The recognition system traces the time spent by the
student on the portal and their consistency in solving problems to award them with virtual
coins and badges. The coins can then be used to redeem certain benefits from teachers like
extra computer time, free chocolates etc, and a leader board of students on the basis of
coins and badges can also be prepared.</h3>

<h3>A discussion forum can also be developed where the students can ask their
questions and get it answered by any of their peers. The students who are able to solve the
doubts of their peers are also rewarded with virtual coins. This will enhance peer to peer
learning among students.</h3>
