### Project Details :

<p>Team Electromania is confused over how to conduct interviews in a fair and trouble- free manner. Vivek has come up with an idea of building a live application for coding interviews where one can change the code and instantly see the effect among shared users. This could help people having a low bandwidth network. Embedding programming language support and a mini chat window will make it more sophisticated.<p>

### Basic Feature :

• Ability to create multiple interview rooms with different links and passwords.<br>• Code editor with proper indentation and keyword highlighting for multiple languages. (User must be able to switch across languages).<br>• Edited code should be visible to all users instantly.<br>• Chat Window for communication.

### Advanced Feature :

• Ability to share file across chat window (For sharing resume if required.)<br>• Ability to run code after providing input and getting the result using some available API.<br>• Allow Note taking available for interviewer only.<br>• The candidate is able to join the room only after the interviewer lets them in.<br>• Ability to support multiple interviewers in a single room.
